1.  getrusage()  returns  resource usage measures for who, which can be one of the fol‚Äê
       lowing:

       RUSAGE_SELF
              Return resource usage statistics for the calling process, which is  the  sum
              of resources used by all threads in the process.

       RUSAGE_CHILDREN
              Return  resource  usage  statistics  for all children of the calling process
              that have terminated and been waited for.  These statistics will include the
              resources  used by grandchildren, and further removed descendants, if all of
              the intervening descendants waited on their terminated children.

       RUSAGE_THREAD (since Linux 2.6.26)
              Return resource usage statistics for the calling thread.

2.  struct rusage
    {
       struct timeval ru_utime; /* user CPU time used */
       struct timeval ru_stime; /* system CPU time used */
       long   ru_maxrss;        /* maximum resident set size */
       long   ru_ixrss;         /* integral shared memory size */
       long   ru_idrss;         /* integral unshared data size */
       long   ru_isrss;         /* integral unshared stack size */
       long   ru_minflt;        /* page reclaims (soft page faults) */
       long   ru_majflt;        /* page faults (hard page faults) */
       long   ru_nswap;         /* swaps */
       long   ru_inblock;       /* block input operations */
       long   ru_oublock;       /* block output operations */
       long   ru_msgsnd;        /* IPC messages sent */
       long   ru_msgrcv;        /* IPC messages received */
       long   ru_nsignals;      /* signals received */
       long   ru_nvcsw;         /* voluntary context switches */
       long   ru_nivcsw;        /* involuntary context switches */
    };

3.  Before and after are structs and are slow to pass by value.
    If we pass a reference then the calcualte function has acess
    to the same information with alot less computational cost.

4. Main uses fgetc to read the next character in the file and move the
   pointer with it. Using this with a loop that terminates on the EOF character
   creates a loop that reads a file character by character until it reaches the
   end of the file. After it reads the character it checks that it is a aplha character
   or an apostrophe and then appends the character to the end of the word char array.
   If the loop reaches a space or punctuation we add a null terminator the the word array.

5.  fscanf will include any character that is not whitespace or a newline.
    So using this would cause punctuation to be included in the words we are checking.

6.  A const is not changeable. check and load function take a const to make sure we
    do not change the word we are checking or the dictionary we are checking from.
